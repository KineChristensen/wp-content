            <h3>Showing grids on your website</h3>
            <p>Once you've create a grid you can easily add it to any part of your website with the available shortcodes, shown in the top right of the Grid page.</p>
            <p>The easiest way to add the shortcode is using the WP Ultimate Post Grid icon in the editor.</p>
            <p>If your grid is using filters there will be a different shortcode for the filter. Make sure to add both where you want them.</p>

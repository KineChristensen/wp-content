Create responsive carousels or sliders where the content for each slide can be anything you want - images, text, HTML, and even shortcodes.

== Description ==

Slide Anything allows you to create a carousel/slider where the content for each slide can be anything you want - images, text, HTML, and even shortcodes. This plugin uses the Owl Carousel 2 jQuery plugin, and lets you create beautiful, touch enabled, responsive carousels and sliders.

= Slide Anything Version 2 =

Slide Anything has now been rebuilt using Owl Carousel 2, and this now provides many improvements and new features:

* Infinite Looping - a much requested Owl Carousel 2 feature, which means that the first slide is now seamlessly displayed after the last slide without any carousel rewind.
* New Transition Effects - New Owl Carousel transitions include Slide, Fade, Zoom In, Zoom Out, Flip Out X/Y, Rotate Left/Right, Bounce Out, Roll Out and Slide Down.
* Slide Link Feature - A new feature which allows you to create a hover-over link button for any slide within your carousels.
*  Modern Browsers - Owl Carousel 2 Uses hardware acceleration with CSS3 Translate3D transitions. Its fast and works like a charm! Slide Anything has CSS2 fallback built-in to support older browsers.

= Slide Anything PRO =

[SLIDE ANYTHING PRO](http://edgewebpages.com/) adds POPUPS into the mix!!

With [SLIDE ANYTHING PRO](http://edgewebpages.com/) each slide can now open a MODAL POPUP, which can be an IMAGE popup, a VIDEO EMBED popup (YouTube/Vimeo), a popup containing HTML CODE or a popup displaying a WordPress SHORTCODE. This can be a very useful addition to Slide Anything, if you are wanting to create Image or Video galleries for your websites.

= Owl Carousel =

[Owl Carousel](https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/) is an extremely powerful and flexible carousel/slider JQuery plugin, and it is also free to use! Unfortunately, it's not easy to integrate Owl Carousel into a WordPress site if you are a non-developer, and requires JQuery and PHP coding skills. That is why I developed this plugin.

I use Owl Carousel a in various WordPress sites I develop, specifically where I need the additional flexibility to develop a carousel with a more complex layout, or use a layout not catered for by any existing carousel plugin product.

Owl Carousel has been tested in following browsers/devices: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, IE7/8/10/11, Microsoft Edge, iPhone/iPad/Mac Safari and Android Chrome.

Please view the [FAQ Page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/slide-anything/faq/) for information on how to use `Slide Anything`.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `slide-anything` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu within the WordPress Dashboard.

You will now see the `Sliders` menu in your WordPress admin panel.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I insert `Slide Anything` sliders into my WordPress pages or posts? =

There are two ways to do this. If you are using the visual editor to edit a page or post, you will see a `Slide Anything Sliders` button/icon in the toolbar of the editor. Click this button and a popup will be displayed containing a list of sliders that you have created. Select the title of a slider within this list and click `OK` to insert the shortcode for the selected slider into your page or post content.

The other method: When you are editing your slider within the WordPress Dashboard, you will see a box with the heading `Shortcode / Preview` on the right-hand side. Click the `Copy to Clipboard` button within this box to copy the slider shortcode to your clipboard. Paste this copied shortcode into the page or post where you would like your slider to appear. This is also the method to use if you want to insert your slider into a text widget or another custom content type, such as a portfolio post.

= The difference between a Slider and a Carousel, and how to create either =

By definition a `slider` has a single slide displayed on-page at a time, whilst a `carousel` has multiple slides displayed 'on-page' at a time. The `Items Displayed` box, on the right-hand side of the slider edit page in the WordPress dashboard controls how many slides are displayed on-page at a time.

To define a slider, all the settings within this box must be set to `1`. When these are set to values greater than `1`, a carousel will be displayed, for example you may want to display a carousel with 4 slides visible on desktop devices, 3 slides visible on tablets and only 2 slides visible on mobile phones.

= How do I define slide background images? =

The `Slide Background` box for each slide in your slider allows you to define a background image or a background color for each slide. Note that the content you add to each slide within the slide editor box for each slide is foreground content and sits on `top` of the slide background - this content can be other images and textual content.

To set a slide background image, click the `Set Image` button. The `Background Size` setting determines if, and how the background image is stretched/shrunk to cover the slide content area and the `Background Repeat` setting determines if the backgroung image should be repeated, like tiles. The `Background Color` setting allows you set a color for the slide background - note that you can have both a slide background color AND a slide background image. The small background preview window to the left of these settings give you an indication on how the settings you choose will look.

The `Min Height` setting (within the `Slider Style` box), is often used in conjunction with defining slide backgrounds, as this setting controls how much of the slide background is visible if the slide contains no (foreground) content.

= How do I use the `Slider Style` settings? =

At the top of this box, which appears on the right-hand side when editing a slider, you can set and copy the CSS `ID` for the slider. This is useful for developers who are familiar with CSS coding, and this CSS `ID` can be used to create custom styles for your slider within your theme or child-theme's style/CSS file.

The `Padding (pixels)` settings are used to define the amount of padding space around the entire slider - top, right, bottom and left. The `Background/Border` settings define the background colour for the entire slider (`Note:` each slide's background image/color will appear on top of this slider background), and also if a border should appear around the entire slider - the width, color and border radius of this border.

The `SLIDE STYLE` settings are the style settings for each individual slide with the slider/carousel. Here you can define the minimum height each slide and also the padding space around each slide.

= 2.1.1 =
* Bug Fix - Owl Carousel changed the CSS Style used for slide images in version 2.3. Changed the CSS style for images back to what was used in version 2.2.1 of Owl Carousel, so that sliders already created on sites continue to look the same.

Certain shortcodes can only be displayed on the front-end (i.e. required resources are only loaded on the front-end), so the 'Preview Slider' feature on the Edit Slider page was causing issues for these shortcodes. So I have displayed this 'Preview Slider' feature for sliders where the 'Allow Shortcodes' checkbox is checked.
